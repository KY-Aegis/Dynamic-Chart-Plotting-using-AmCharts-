# Dynamic-Chart-Plotting-using-AmCharts-
Plotting multiple charts such as Radio Chart from AmCharts Library may require some coding effort to be plotted. This code aims to eliminate the need to create an independant code for each chart by dynamically plotting out x amount of charts depending on the data that was used to plot the charts in the form of a JSON file.
